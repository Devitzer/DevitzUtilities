# Introduction

âœ¨ Imagine a simple utilities system that permits you to do your tasks quicker and easier! (mostly)

# Installation

First, in your shell. Run ```npm i devitzutilities``` <br>

And then, in whatever file you need it in simply type up ```const devitz = require('devitzutilities')```

# Commands

I will make a help command soon! But until then, you can check if it works yet by running devitz.support.help()!
